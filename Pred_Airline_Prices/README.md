# Predicting the Prices of Airline_Tickets using Random_Forest Algorithm
## Project Description:

Developed a machine learning model to predict airline prices using the random forest algorithm accurately. Utilized a dataset containing historical flight data, including factors such as departure and arrival times, airline carriers, route information, and seasonal patterns.

## Key Contributions:

-> We conducted comprehensive data preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature selection, and feature engineering, to ensure high-quality input for the model.

-> We implemented the random forest algorithm to create a robust prediction model capable of handling complex interactions between features and capturing non-linear relationships.

-> Conducted thorough feature importance analysis to identify the most influential factors affecting airline prices, enabling actionable insights for pricing strategies and revenue management.

-> Utilized appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) to measure model performance and compared it with other popular algorithms to validate the effectiveness of the random forest approach.

-> Created visually appealing data visualizations and intuitive charts to communicate the results effectively to stakeholders, including the project team and management.

## Skills Demonstrated:

-> Proficient in data preprocessing techniques, including data cleaning, feature selection, and feature engineering.

-> Strong knowledge of machine learning algorithms, notably the random forest algorithm, and its application in predicting continuous variables.

-> Proficient in evaluating and interpreting model results using appropriate evaluation metrics.

-> Skilled in data visualization tools and techniques to effectively communicate complex findings.

### This project showcases my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems and derive valuable insights. Using the random forest algorithm, I successfully predicted airline prices with high accuracy, providing actionable recommendations for the airline industry.
